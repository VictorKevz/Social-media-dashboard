## Repository

## Instructions

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The only JavaScript required is for the color theme toggle.

Your users should be able to:
- Toggle color theme to their preference
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
